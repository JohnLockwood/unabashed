# unaBashed
Tools and resources for Linux shell programming, especially in Bash.  Please note that at present 
this is in a state of development and may not be ready for use.  **This is especially true of install.sh, which 
caused me an issue when moving from WSL to Mac and may not be safe yet.  DO NOT USE**.
